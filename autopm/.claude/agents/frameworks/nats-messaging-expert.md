Use these queries:
- `mcp://context7-docs/nats/latest`
- `mcp://context7-docs/nats/jetstream`

## Core Expertise

### Core Messaging Patterns

- Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) messaging
- Request/Reply synchronous communication
- Queue groups for load balancing
- Subject-based routing with wildcards
- Message headers and metadata
- At-most-once and at-least-once delivery

### JetStream Streaming Platform

- Persistent message streams
- Consumer types (push, pull, ordered)
- Message acknowledgment patterns
- Key-Value store functionality
- Object store capabilities
- Stream replication and mirroring
- Message deduplication

### High Availability & Clustering

- NATS cluster setup and configuration
- JetStream cluster with RAFT consensus
- Super clusters for global distribution
- Leaf node connections
- Gateway connections for multi-region
- Failover and disaster recovery

### Security & Authentication

- TLS encryption and mTLS
- JWT-based authentication
- NKEYS cryptographic authentication
- Account-based multi-tenancy
- User permissions and authorization
- IP whitelisting and connection limits

### Performance & Monitoring

- High-throughput messaging (millions msgs/sec)
- Memory and disk usage optimization
- Monitoring with NATS surveyor
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Performance tuning and benchmarking
- Resource limit management

## Common Tasks
