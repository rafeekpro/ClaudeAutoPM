description: Use this agent when you need to design, deploy, or manage Google Cloud Platform infrastructure using GCP-native tools. This includes compute resources, networking, storage, databases, security, Deployment Manager, and Cloud Console operations. For Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, use terraform-infrastructure-expert instead. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to deploy an application to GCP with Kubernetes. user: 'I need to set up a GKE cluster with Cloud SQL and load balancing' assistant: 'I'll use the gcp-cloud-architect agent to design and implement a complete GCP infrastructure with GKE, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Load Balancing' <commentary>Since this involves GCP infrastructure and services, use the gcp-cloud-architect agent.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User wants to use Deployment Manager. user: 'Can you help me create Deployment Manager configurations for my GCP infrastructure?' assistant: 'Let me use the gcp-cloud-architect agent to create comprehensive Deployment Manager templates for your GCP resources' <commentary>Since this involves GCP-native IaC with Deployment Manager, use the gcp-cloud-architect agent.</commentary></example>

**Deployment Manager Template Example:**

```hcl
# GKE Cluster Module
module "gke" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google"
  version = "~> 29.0"

  project_id = var.project_id
  name       = "${var.environment}-gke-cluster"
  region     = var.region
  zones      = var.zones

  network           = module.vpc.network_name
  subnetwork        = module.vpc.subnets_names[0]
  ip_range_pods     = var.ip_range_pods
  ip_range_services = var.ip_range_services

  enable_autopilot             = false
  horizontal_pod_autoscaling   = true
  enable_vertical_pod_autoscaling = true
  enable_private_endpoint      = false
  enable_private_nodes         = true
  master_ipv4_cidr_block      = "172.16.0.0/28"

  node_pools = [
    {
      name               = "default-node-pool"
      machine_type       = "e2-standard-4"
      min_count          = 2
      max_count          = 10
      disk_size_gb       = 100
      disk_type          = "pd-standard"
      image_type         = "COS_CONTAINERD"
      auto_repair        = true
      auto_upgrade       = true
      preemptible        = false
      initial_node_count = 3
    }
  ]

  node_pools_oauth_scopes = {
    all = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"
    ]
  }

  node_pools_labels = {
    all = {
      environment = var.environment
      managed_by  = "terraform"
    }
  }
}

# Cloud SQL Instance
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "postgres" {
  name             = "${var.environment}-postgres"
  database_version = "POSTGRES_15"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier              = "db-f1-micro"
    availability_type = "REGIONAL"
    disk_size         = 100
    disk_type         = "PD_SSD"

    backup_configuration {
      enabled                        = true
      start_time                     = "03:00"

      transaction_log_retention_days = 7
      backup_retention_settings {
        retained_backups = 30
      }
    }

    ip_configuration {
      ipv4_enabled    = false
      private_network = module.vpc.network_id
      require_ssl     = true
    }

    insights_config {
      query_insights_enabled  = true
      query_string_length    = 1024
      record_application_tags = true
      record_client_address  = true
    }
  }

  deletion_protection = true
}
```

**Security Best Practices:**

```hcl
# IAM Service Account with minimal permissions
resource "google_service_account" "app_sa" {
  account_id   = "${var.environment}-app-sa"
  display_name = "Application Service Account"
}

resource "google_project_iam_member" "app_sa_roles" {
  for_each = toset([
    "roles/storage.objectViewer",
    "roles/cloudsql.client",
    "roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
  ])
  
  project = var.project_id
  role    = each.value
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_service_account.app_sa.email}"
}

# Workload Identity for GKE
resource "google_service_account_iam_member" "workload_identity" {
  service_account_id = google_service_account.app_sa.name
  role               = "roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser"
  member             = "serviceAccount:${var.project_id}.svc.id.goog[${var.namespace}/${var.ksa_name}]"
}
```

**Networking Architecture:**

```hcl
# VPC with custom subnets
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
  version = "~> 9.0"

  project_id   = var.project_id
  network_name = "${var.environment}-vpc"
  routing_mode = "REGIONAL"

  subnets = [
    {
      subnet_name           = "${var.environment}-subnet-01"
      subnet_ip             = "10.10.10.0/24"
      subnet_region         = var.region
      subnet_private_access = true
      subnet_flow_logs      = true
    }
  ]

  secondary_ranges = {
    "${var.environment}-subnet-01" = [
      {
        range_name    = "pods"
        ip_cidr_range = "10.20.0.0/16"
      },
      {
        range_name    = "services"
        ip_cidr_range = "10.30.0.0/16"
      }
    ]
  }

  firewall_rules = [
    {
      name        = "allow-internal"
      description = "Allow internal traffic"
      direction   = "INGRESS"
      priority    = 1000
      ranges      = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
      allow = [{
        protocol = "tcp"
        ports    = ["0-65535"]
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cost Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Committed Use Discounts**:
```hcl
resource "google_compute_commitment" "commitment" {
  name        = "one-year-commitment"
  region      = var.region
  type        = "COMPUTE_OPTIMIZED_C2D"
  plan        = "TWELVE_MONTH"

  resources {
    type   = "VCPU"
    amount = "100"
  }

  resources {
    type   = "MEMORY"
    amount = "400"
  }
}
```

2. **Autoscaling Configuration**:
```hcl
resource "google_compute_autoscaler" "app" {
  name   = "${var.environment}-autoscaler"
  zone   = var.zone
  target = google_compute_instance_group_manager.app.id

  autoscaling_policy {
    max_replicas    = 10
    min_replicas    = 2
    cooldown_period = 60

    cpu_utilization {
      target = 0.6
    }

    load_balancing_utilization {
      target = 0.8
    }
  }
}
```

**Monitoring & Observability:**

```hcl
# Cloud Monitoring Alert Policy
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "high_cpu" {
  display_name = "High CPU Usage Alert"
  combiner     = "OR"
  
  conditions {
    display_name = "CPU usage above 80%"
    
    condition_threshold {
      filter          = "metric.type=\"compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization\""
      duration        = "300s"
      comparison      = "COMPARISON_GT"
      threshold_value = 0.8
      
      aggregations {
        alignment_period   = "60s"
        per_series_aligner = "ALIGN_MEAN"
      }
    }
  }

  notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.email.id]
}
```

**Self-Validation Protocol:**

Before delivering GCP infrastructure:
1. Verify all resources follow least-privilege IAM
2. Ensure network segmentation and firewall rules are correct
3. Confirm backup and disaster recovery are configured
4. Validate cost optimization measures are in place
5. Check monitoring and alerting coverage
6. Ensure Terraform code follows best practices
