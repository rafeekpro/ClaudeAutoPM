## Implementation Patterns

### Optimized Table Design

```sql
-- Partitioned and clustered table with nested structures
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.events`
PARTITION BY DATE(event_timestamp)
CLUSTER BY user_id, event_type
OPTIONS(
  description="User events with nested attributes",
  partition_expiration_days=90
)
AS
SELECT
  event_id,
  user_id,
  event_type,
  event_timestamp,
  -- Nested structure for properties
  STRUCT(
    device.type AS device_type,
    device.os AS os,
    device.browser AS browser
  ) AS device_info,
  -- Array of custom properties
  ARRAY(
    SELECT AS STRUCT
      key,
      value
    FROM UNNEST(properties)
  ) AS event_properties,
  -- Geographical data
  ST_GEOGPOINT(longitude, latitude) AS location
FROM raw_events;

-- Create index for search optimization
CREATE SEARCH INDEX events_search_idx
ON `project.dataset.events`(event_type, event_properties);
```

### Advanced SQL Patterns

```sql
-- Window functions for analytics
WITH user_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    DATE(event_timestamp) AS event_date,
    COUNT(*) AS daily_events,
    -- Running total
    SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id 
      ORDER BY DATE(event_timestamp)
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS cumulative_events,
    -- Moving average
    AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id 
      ORDER BY DATE(event_timestamp)
      ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS events_7day_avg,
    -- Rank within user
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY user_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    ) AS activity_rank
  FROM `project.dataset.events`
  WHERE event_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  GROUP BY user_id, event_date
)
SELECT * FROM user_metrics
WHERE activity_rank <= 10;

-- Pivot table for cross-tab analysis
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT
    product_category,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) AS month,
    total_amount
  FROM `project.dataset.sales`
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2024
)
PIVOT (
  SUM(total_amount) AS revenue
  FOR month IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
);
```

### BigQuery ML Examples

```sql
-- Create and train a forecasting model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='ARIMA_PLUS',
  time_series_timestamp_col='date',
  time_series_data_col='daily_revenue',
  time_series_id_col='product_category',
  holiday_region='US',
  auto_arima=TRUE
) AS
SELECT
  DATE(transaction_date) AS date,
  product_category,
  SUM(total_amount) AS daily_revenue
FROM `project.dataset.sales`
GROUP BY date, product_category;

-- Evaluate model performance
SELECT
  *
FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`);

-- Generate forecasts
SELECT
  *
FROM ML.FORECAST(
  MODEL `project.dataset.sales_forecast`,
  STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.95 AS confidence_level)
);

-- Customer segmentation with K-means
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project.dataset.customer_segments`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='KMEANS',
  num_clusters=5,
  distance_type='COSINE'
) AS
SELECT
  user_id,
  total_purchases,
  avg_order_value,
  days_since_last_purchase,
  lifetime_value
FROM `project.dataset.customer_features`;
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

```sql
-- Materialized view for expensive aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `project.dataset.daily_summary`
PARTITION BY summary_date
CLUSTER BY product_category
AS
SELECT
  DATE(transaction_date) AS summary_date,
  product_category,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers,
  COUNT(*) AS transaction_count,
  SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue,
  AVG(total_amount) AS avg_transaction_value
FROM `project.dataset.sales`
GROUP BY summary_date, product_category;

-- Query pruning with _PARTITIONDATE
SELECT *
FROM `project.dataset.events`
WHERE _PARTITIONDATE BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
  AND user_id = 'user123';

-- Approximate aggregation for cost reduction
SELECT
  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id) AS unique_users,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(total_amount, 100)[OFFSET(50)] AS median_amount,
  APPROX_TOP_COUNT(product_category, 10) AS top_categories
FROM `project.dataset.sales`
WHERE transaction_date >= CURRENT_DATE() - 30;
```

### Streaming Ingestion

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
import json

client = bigquery.Client()
table_id = "project.dataset.real_time_events"

# Streaming insert
def stream_events(events):
    table = client.get_table(table_id)
    errors = client.insert_rows_json(
        table, 
        events,
        row_ids=[event['event_id'] for event in events]
    )
    
    if errors:
        print(f"Failed to insert rows: {errors}")
    else:
        print(f"Streamed {len(events)} events")

# Template table for streaming
def create_streaming_table():
    schema = [
        bigquery.SchemaField("event_id", "STRING", mode="REQUIRED"),
        bigquery.SchemaField("timestamp", "TIMESTAMP", mode="REQUIRED"),
        bigquery.SchemaField("data", "JSON", mode="NULLABLE"),
    ]
    
    table = bigquery.Table(table_id, schema=schema)
    table.time_partitioning = bigquery.TimePartitioning(
        type_=bigquery.TimePartitioningType.HOUR,
        field="timestamp"
    )
    table.clustering_fields = ["event_id"]
    
    table = client.create_table(table)
    print(f"Created table {table.project}.{table.dataset_id}.{table.table_id}")
```

## Best Practices

### Schema Design

- **Use nested structures**: Reduce joins and improve performance
- **Partition tables**: Reduce data scanned and costs
- **Cluster frequently filtered columns**: Improve query performance
- **Denormalize when appropriate**: Trade storage for query speed
- **Use appropriate data types**: Minimize storage costs

### Query Optimization

- **Filter early**: Push down predicates to reduce data scanned
- **Use approximate functions**: When exact counts aren't needed
- **Avoid SELECT ***: Specify only needed columns
- **Leverage caching**: Reuse recent query results
- **Monitor slot usage**: Optimize for flat-rate pricing

### Cost Management

- **Set up cost controls**: Budget alerts and quotas
- **Use partitioning and clustering**: Reduce bytes scanned
- **Implement data lifecycle**: Archive or delete old data
- **Use scheduled queries wisely**: Batch processing in off-peak
- **Monitor query costs**: Tag queries for cost attribution
