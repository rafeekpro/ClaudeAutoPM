## ⚙️ TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

This project uses a traditional development approach focused on native tooling and direct local execution.

### 🏠 Development Environment

- **Local execution** - Run code directly on your machine
- **Native tooling** - Use language-specific tools (npm, pip, etc.)
- **System dependencies** - Install requirements locally
- **Traditional testing** - Standard test runners and frameworks

### 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies locally**
   ```bash
   # Node.js projects
   npm install
   
   # Python projects  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Other languages as appropriate
   ```

2. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   # Use standard development commands
   npm run dev
   python app.py
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   # Use native test runners
   npm test
   pytest
   # etc.
   ```

### 📋 Development Rules

- Use native language tools and package managers
- Install dependencies on local system
- Run tests using standard frameworks
- Deploy using traditional methods (not containerized)
