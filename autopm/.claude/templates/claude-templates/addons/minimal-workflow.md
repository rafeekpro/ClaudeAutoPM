# Traditional Development Workflow

## ⚙️ TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

This project uses a traditional development approach focused on native tooling and direct local execution.

### 🏠 Development Environment

- **Local execution** - Run code directly on your machine
- **Native tooling** - Use language-specific tools (npm, pip, etc.)
- **System dependencies** - Install requirements locally
- **Traditional testing** - Standard test runners and frameworks

### 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Check project type and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Detect project type from files present
   # package.json → Node.js/React/Vue/Next.js
   # requirements.txt/Pipfile → Python/Django/Flask
   # go.mod → Go
   # Cargo.toml → Rust
   # pom.xml → Java/Maven
   # build.gradle → Java/Gradle
   # composer.json → PHP
   # Gemfile → Ruby
   ```

2. **Install dependencies based on project type**

   ```bash
   # Project-specific installation commands will be used
   # The framework will detect and use the appropriate commands
   ```

3. **Run development and tests**

   ```bash
   # Commands will be determined from:
   # - package.json scripts (Node.js)
   # - Makefile targets (if present)
   # - Standard conventions for the detected language
   # - README.md instructions
   ```

### 📋 Development Rules

- Use native language tools and package managers
- Install dependencies on local system
- Run tests using standard frameworks
- Deploy using traditional methods (not containerized)
