## Project Management

This project uses local development workflow without CI/CD automation.

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Make changes locally
   - Run tests manually
   - Commit when ready

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Test changes locally before committing
   - Use project-specific test commands
   - Verify functionality manually

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy manually as needed
   - Follow project-specific deployment procedures
   - Coordinate with team for releases

### Version Control
```bash
# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```

Focus on code quality and manual verification before commits.
