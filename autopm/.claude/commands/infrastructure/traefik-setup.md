# Traefik Reverse Proxy Setup Command

Configure Traefik reverse proxy with SSL termination, load balancing, and service discovery.

## Command
```
/infra:traefik-setup
```

## Purpose
Use the traefik-proxy-expert agent to create a complete Traefik reverse proxy configuration with SSL automation, load balancing, and microservices routing.

## Parameters
- `environment`: Target environment (development, staging, production)
- `ssl`: SSL configuration (letsencrypt, custom-certs, self-signed)
- `discovery`: Service discovery method (docker, kubernetes, file)
- `features`: Additional features (dashboard, metrics, rate-limiting, auth)

## Agent Usage
```
Use the traefik-proxy-expert agent to create a comprehensive Traefik reverse proxy setup.
```

## Expected Outcome
- Complete Traefik configuration (traefik.yml)
- Docker Compose setup with Traefik service
- SSL certificate automation
- Service discovery configuration
- Load balancing and health checks
- Security middleware and authentication
- Monitoring and logging setup

## Example Usage
```
## Required Documentation Access

**MANDATORY:** Before Traefik setup, query Context7 for best practices:

**Documentation Queries:**
- `mcp://context7/infrastructure/reverse-proxy` - reverse proxy best practices
- `mcp://context7/traefik/configuration` - configuration best practices
- `mcp://context7/devops/networking` - networking best practices
- `mcp://context7/security/tls` - tls best practices

**Why This is Required:**
- Ensures adherence to current industry standards and best practices
- Prevents outdated or incorrect implementation patterns
- Provides access to latest framework/tool documentation
- Reduces errors from stale knowledge or assumptions
