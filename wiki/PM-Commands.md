# PM Commands

PM (Project Management) commands provide a unified interface for managing projects, issues, epics, and PRDs within Claude Code. These commands work across different providers (GitHub, Azure DevOps) through the provider abstraction layer.

## Command Structure

All PM commands follow the pattern:
```
/pm:resource:action [parameters]
```

- **pm**: Project Management prefix
- **resource**: The type of resource (issue, epic, prd, etc.)
- **action**: The operation to perform (show, list, create, etc.)

## Quick Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pm:help` | Show all available commands |
| `/pm:init` | Initialize project management |
| `/pm:status` | Show project status |
| `/pm:standup` | Generate standup report |
| `/pm:next` | Show next task to work on |

## Provider-Specific Behavior

### GitHub

- Issues map to GitHub Issues
- Epics use GitHub Projects
- PRDs stored as markdown in repo
- Labels for categorization

### Azure DevOps

- Issues map to Work Items
- Epics use Azure Epics
- PRDs as wiki pages
- Area paths for organization

## Configuration

### Provider Settings

In `.claude/config.json`:

```json
{
  "projectManagement": {
    "provider": "github",
    "repository": "owner/repo",
    "project": "Project Name",
    "features": {
      "auto_assign": true,
      "auto_label": true,
      "epic_tracking": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Command Aliases

Create custom aliases in `.claude/commands/pm/aliases.md`:

```markdown
/pm:todo → /pm:issue:list --assignee=@me --status=todo
/pm:wip → /pm:issue:list --status=in-progress
/pm:done → /pm:issue:list --status=done --sprint=current
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Sync**: Run `/pm:sync` daily
2. **Status Updates**: Use `/pm:standup` for daily updates
3. **Epic Decomposition**: Break down epics before starting
4. **Validation**: Run `/pm:validate` weekly
5. **Clean Up**: Use `/pm:clean` at sprint end

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

```markdown
/pm:help
# Shows all available commands

# If still not working:
- Check provider configuration
- Verify authentication
- Run /pm:init
```

### Sync Issues

```markdown
# Force refresh
/pm:sync --force

# Check connection
/pm:validate
```

### Performance

```markdown
# Clear cache
/pm:clean --cache

# Optimize queries
/pm:sync --optimize
```
