   - Mitigation: Start payment integration early, allocate buffer time

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Risk: System may not handle 1,000+ concurrent users
   - Mitigation: Load testing from Phase 2, implement caching strategy

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Risk: E-commerce platforms are high-value targets
   - Mitigation: Security audit in Phase 4, penetration testing

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Feature requests may delay timeline
   - Mitigation: Strict prioritization, defer non-critical features to Phase 5

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)
