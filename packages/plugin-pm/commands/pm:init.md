## Required Documentation Access

**MANDATORY:** Before project management workflows, query Context7 for best practices:

**Documentation Queries:**
- `mcp://context7/agile/epic-management` - epic management best practices
- `mcp://context7/project-management/issue-tracking` - issue tracking best practices
- `mcp://context7/agile/task-breakdown` - task breakdown best practices

**Why This is Required:**
- Ensures adherence to current industry standards and best practices
