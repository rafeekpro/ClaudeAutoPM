# Hybrid Workflow Demonstration

This document demonstrates the hybrid workflow in action.

## Workflow Types

### Direct Commit (for hotfixes)
Used for the previous commit that fixed the DevOps inconsistency.

### Pull Request (for features)
This PR demonstrates the feature workflow path.

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Flexibility** - Choose the right workflow for the task
2. **Speed** - Direct commits for urgent fixes
3. **Review** - PRs for features needing discussion
4. **Quality** - CI/CD runs on both workflows

## Example Decision Flow

```
Was it a critical DevOps fix? → Yes → Direct commit ✓
Is this a demo feature? → Yes → Pull Request ✓
```

This PR itself demonstrates that both workflows coexist successfully!
