# Agent Task Creation Enhancement - Complete Summary

## 📋 Overview

All framework and language agents have been enhanced with **Context7 queries and guidelines for task creation**. This ensures that when agents create tasks during epic decomposition, they follow industry-standard agile and project management best practices.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:**
- Agents had Context7 queries for **technical documentation** only (React, TypeScript, Node.js, etc.)
- No guidance for **task structure, acceptance criteria, or estimation**
- Task quality depended on agent's training data (potentially outdated)
- Inconsistent task formats across different agents

**After:**
- Agents query Context7 for **both technical AND task creation** best practices
- Enforced INVEST criteria for all tasks
- Consistent task structure with frontmatter, TDD requirements, and Definition of Done
- Up-to-date agile methodologies applied

## ✅ Agents Updated (11 total)

### Language Agents (4)
1. **javascript-frontend-engineer** - JavaScript/TypeScript frontend
2. **nodejs-backend-engineer** - Node.js backend APIs
3. **bash-scripting-expert** - Shell automation and system administration
4. **python-backend-engineer** - Python backend development

### Framework Agents (7)
5. **react-frontend-engineer** - React component architecture
6. **react-ui-expert** - React UI frameworks
7. **tailwindcss-expert** - TailwindCSS styling
8. **ux-design-expert** - UX design and accessibility
9. **e2e-test-engineer** - E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
10. **nats-messaging-expert** - NATS messaging patterns
11. **python-backend-expert** - Python frameworks (Django, FastAPI)

## 📦 What Was Added

### 1. Task Creation Context7 Queries

Added to every agent's "Documentation Queries" section:

```markdown
**Documentation Queries (Task Creation):**
- `mcp://context7/agile/task-breakdown` - Task decomposition patterns
- `mcp://context7/agile/user-stories` - INVEST criteria for tasks
- `mcp://context7/agile/acceptance-criteria` - Writing effective AC
- `mcp://context7/project-management/estimation` - Effort estimation
```

### 2. Task Creation Excellence Section

Added new section to every agent:

```markdown
## Task Creation Excellence

When creating implementation tasks (for epic decomposition or project planning):

1. **Query Context7 First**: Access latest agile/PM best practices
2. **Follow INVEST Criteria**: Tasks must be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
3. **Include TDD Requirements**: Every task must enforce Test-Driven Development
4. **Technology-Specific Details**: Leverage your [tech] expertise in technical details
5. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable, testable criteria

**Task Structure Template**: Frontmatter with name, status, created, depends_on, parallel, conflicts_with. Sections for Description, TDD Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Details, Dependencies, Effort Estimate, Definition of Done.

**Quality Standards**:
- Tasks completable in 1-3 days maximum
- Action-oriented titles (verb + noun)
- Specific [technology] implementation guidance
- Dependency and parallelization mapping
- [Technology-specific considerations]
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Epic Decomposition Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[/pm:epic-decompose] --> B[Read Epic]
    B --> C[Invoke Agent]
    C --> D[Agent: Query Context7 Technical]
    D --> E[Agent: Query Context7 Task Creation]
    E --> F[Agent: Create Tasks with Both]
    F --> G[Tasks Follow INVEST + Tech Best Practices]
```

### Example: React Task Creation

**Before Enhancement:**
```markdown
Agent only queries:
- React documentation
- TypeScript patterns

Creates task based on training data
```

**After Enhancement:**
```markdown
Agent queries:
- React documentation (technical)
- TypeScript patterns (technical)
- Task breakdown patterns (agile)
- INVEST criteria (agile)
- Acceptance criteria standards (PM)
- Effort estimation techniques (PM)

Creates task with:
✅ Latest React patterns
✅ Industry-standard task structure
✅ INVEST-compliant format
✅ TDD enforcement
✅ Clear AC and DoD
```

## 📊 Task Quality Improvements

### Structure Enforcement

**Every task now includes:**

```markdown
---
name: Setup React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
status: open
created: 2025-01-15T14:30:00Z
depends_on: []
parallel: true
conflicts_with: []
---

# Task: Setup React 18 with TypeScript and Vite

## Description
[Clear description from Context7 best practices]

## ⚠️ TDD Requirements
**This project uses Test-Driven Development:**
1. 🔴 RED: Write failing test first
2. 🟢 GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
3. 🔵 REFACTOR: Clean up code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criterion (from Context7 patterns)
- [ ] Measurable criterion
- [ ] Testable criterion

## Technical Details
[Technology-specific from agent expertise]
[Current best practices from Context7]

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task/issue dependencies
- [ ] External dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4h
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Tests written FIRST (RED phase)
- [ ] Code implemented (GREEN phase)
- [ ] Code refactored (REFACTOR phase)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### INVEST Criteria Compliance

All tasks are validated against:

- **I**ndependent - Can be worked on separately
- **N**egotiable - Details can be refined
- **V**aluable - Delivers clear value
- **E**stimable - Can be sized accurately
- **S**mall - Completable in 1-3 days
- **T**estable - Has clear verification criteria

## 🎓 Benefits

## 🔍 Verification

Test that agents create high-quality tasks:

```bash
# 1. Create test PRD
/pm:prd-parse test-feature

# 2. Split into epics
/pm:epic-split test-feature

# 3. Decompose (agents will be invoked)
/pm:epic-decompose test-feature

# 4. Inspect generated tasks
cat .claude/epics/test-feature/01-*/001.md

# Check for:
# ✅ Proper frontmatter (depends_on, parallel, conflicts_with)
# ✅ TDD Requirements section
# ✅ Specific Acceptance Criteria
# ✅ Technology-specific Technical Details
# ✅ Effort Estimate with parallel flag
# ✅ Complete Definition of Done
```

## 📝 Implementation Files
