# Documentation Audit Report

## Executive Summary
After major architectural changes, performance optimizations, and test coverage improvements, the documentation requires comprehensive updates to reflect the current state of ClaudeAutoPM.

## Major Changes Requiring Documentation

### 1. Provider Architecture (NEW)
- Unified provider-agnostic command interface (`/pm:resource:action`)
- Provider router with automatic command routing
- Support for GitHub, Azure DevOps, and future providers
- Provider-specific extensions and configurations

### 2. Performance Optimizations (NEW)
- Azure DevOps caching system (80% API call reduction)
- Request batching for bulk operations
- Exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Optimized module loading with caching

### 3. Self-Maintenance System (UPDATED)
- Complete Node.js rewrite (replacing bash scripts)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- New commands: `pm:health`, `pm:validate`, `pm:optimize`, `pm:metrics`
- Performance benchmarking tools

### 4. Test Coverage (IMPROVED)
- Increased from 80.6% to 94.3%
- New E2E test suite
- Quick installation tests
- Performance benchmark tests

### 5. CLI Commands (RESTRUCTURED)
- All commands now use unified `/pm:` prefix
- New command structure: `/pm:<resource>:<action>`
- Provider-agnostic operation
