# Azure DevOps Feature Start

Start working on a Feature - update status, create branch, decompose into stories.

**Usage**: `/azure:feature-start <feature-id> [--branch-name=<name>]`

**Examples**:
- `/azure:feature-start 25`
- `/azure:feature-start 25 --branch-name=feature/auth-system`

## Required Documentation Access

**MANDATORY:** Before Azure DevOps integration and agile workflows, query Context7 for best practices:

**Documentation Queries:**
- `mcp://context7/azure-devops/boards` - boards best practices
- `mcp://context7/agile/user-stories` - user stories best practices
- `mcp://context7/project-management/work-items` - work items best practices
- `mcp://context7/agile/sprint-planning` - sprint planning best practices

**Why This is Required:**
- Ensures adherence to current industry standards and best practices
- Prevents outdated or incorrect implementation patterns
- Provides access to latest framework/tool documentation
- Reduces errors from stale knowledge or assumptions
