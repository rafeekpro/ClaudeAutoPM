## Security by Feature Type

### Database Operations
```sql
-- ‚úÖ SECURE: Parameterized query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;

-- ‚ùå INSECURE: String concatenation
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}';
```

### File Uploads
```javascript
// Security checks required:
- [ ] File type validation (whitelist)
- [ ] File size limits
- [ ] Filename sanitization
- [ ] Virus scanning
- [ ] Store outside web root
- [ ] Generate new filename
- [ ] Check magic numbers
```

### Password Handling
```javascript
// Requirements:
- [ ] Minimum 12 characters
- [ ] Complexity requirements
- [ ] Password history check
- [ ] Bcrypt/Argon2 hashing
- [ ] Salt rounds >= 10
- [ ] No password in logs
- [ ] Secure reset flow
```

### Session Management
```javascript
// Secure session configuration:
- [ ] Secure cookie flag
- [ ] HttpOnly flag
- [ ] SameSite attribute
- [ ] Session timeout
- [ ] Regenerate on login
- [ ] Invalidate on logout
- [ ] CSRF protection
```

## Incident Response Plan

### If Security Breach Detected
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Isolate affected systems
   - [ ] Preserve evidence
   - [ ] Activate incident response team
   - [ ] Begin investigation

2. **Within 1 Hour**
   - [ ] Assess scope of breach
   - [ ] Implement containment measures
   - [ ] Notify security team
   - [ ] Start incident log

3. **Within 24 Hours**
   - [ ] Complete initial assessment
   - [ ] Implement fixes
   - [ ] Notify stakeholders (if required)
   - [ ] Prepare communication plan

4. **Post-Incident**
   - [ ] Complete investigation
   - [ ] Document lessons learned
   - [ ] Update security measures
   - [ ] Conduct security training

## Quick Security Reference

```bash
# NEVER DO THIS:
‚ùå Store passwords in plain text
‚ùå Commit secrets to git
‚ùå Trust user input
‚ùå Use HTTP for sensitive data
‚ùå Log sensitive information
‚ùå Ignore security warnings
‚ùå Deploy with known vulnerabilities

# ALWAYS DO THIS:
‚úÖ Validate all inputs
‚úÖ Encrypt sensitive data
‚úÖ Use parameterized queries
‚úÖ Implement rate limiting
‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated
‚úÖ Follow principle of least privilege
‚úÖ Security test before deployment
```
