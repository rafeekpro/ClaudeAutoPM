# NO AI Contributors Rule

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: AI Assistants Must Never Be Listed as Contributors

### ‚ùå NEVER Include in Commits:
- **Co-Authored-By: Claude** - FORBIDDEN
- **Co-Authored-By: Copilot** - FORBIDDEN
- **Co-Authored-By: GitHub Actions[bot]** - FORBIDDEN
- **Generated with Claude Code** - FORBIDDEN
- **Generated by Copilot** - FORBIDDEN
- Any robot emoji (ü§ñ) with "Generated" text - FORBIDDEN

### ‚úÖ ONLY Human Contributors Allowed:
- Real human developers with valid emails
- Actual team members who contributed code
- External contributors with verified identities

### Git Commit Rules:
1. **NEVER add Co-Authored-By lines for AI assistants**
2. **NEVER mention AI tools in commit messages**
3. **NEVER use robot emojis in commits**
4. **ALWAYS attribute work to human developers only**

### Implementation:
- Git hooks automatically strip AI attributions
- Commit messages are cleaned before finalizing
- CI/CD rejects commits with AI co-authors
- Contributors list shows only humans

### Why This Matters:
- **Legal clarity**: AI cannot hold copyright or be legal contributors
- **Attribution accuracy**: Credit belongs to humans using tools
- **Professional standards**: AI is a tool, not a team member
- **Compliance**: Many organizations prohibit AI attribution

### Enforcement:
```bash
# Git hook removes AI attributions automatically
.githooks/commit-msg

# Local git config filters AI mentions
.gitconfig.local

# CI/CD validation rejects AI contributors
.github/workflows/validate-contributors.yml
```

## REMEMBER: AI assistants are TOOLS, not CONTRIBUTORS!
