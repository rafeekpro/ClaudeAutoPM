# Agent Tool Requirements Audit Summary

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Cloud Architect Descriptions Updated**
   - AWS: Removed Terraform references, focus on CloudFormation/CLI
   - Azure: Removed Terraform references, focus on ARM/Bicep
   - GCP: Removed Terraform references, focus on Deployment Manager

2. **MCP Agent Boundaries Clarified**
   - mcp-manager: Server infrastructure (install, config, processes)
   - mcp-context-manager: Content strategy (optimization, coordination)

3. **Tool Requirements Analysis**
   - Most agents have appropriate tool sets
   - Some optimization opportunities identified:
     - UX/Design agents may not need Bash
     - Database agents could use more specific tools
     - Test agents properly configured

## Recommendations for Tool Optimization

### Low Priority (Can be done later)
1. **ux-design-expert**: Consider removing Bash tool (design-focused)
2. **Database agents**: May benefit from database-specific tools
3. **Documentation agents**: Could use specialized doc tools

### Current Tool Distribution (Appropriate)
- **Infrastructure agents**: Full tool set including Bash ✅
- **Development agents**: Full tool set for coding ✅
- **Test agents**: Proper test execution tools ✅
- **Core agents**: Administrative tool set ✅

## Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE

All Phase 1 objectives have been achieved:
- ✅ Terraform references removed from cloud architects
- ✅ MCP agent boundaries clearly defined
- ✅ Tool requirements audited (minor optimizations noted)

Ready to commit and proceed to Phase 2.
